When accessing AWS resources over the internet, traffic typically travels across various network providers and backbone carriers. This can lead to increased latency and suboptimal performance. AWS Global Accelerator enhances network performance by routing traffic to the nearest AWS edge location and then transporting it over AWS's high-speed global network to its final destination. This optimized routing reduces latency and improves the overall user experience by connecting users to AWS services through the closest entry point.

## Key Features of AWS Global Accelerator

1. **Optimized Traffic Flow:** Global Accelerator uses AWS's internal high-speed backbone network to transport data more efficiently. By directing user traffic to the nearest AWS edge location, it minimizes the number of hops over the public internet, thereby reducing latency and improving performance.
2. **Anycast IP Addresses:** The service provides two IP anycast addresses for redundancy. Anycast addresses allow the same IP to be advertised from multiple locations, enabling traffic to be routed to the closest AWS edge location. This setup not only improves performance but also ensures high availability and failover capabilities if a service or availability zone goes offline.
3. **Global Reach and Resiliency:** AWS Global Accelerator operates across 102 access points in 47 countries, continuously expanding its global edge network. The service's architecture supports multiple regions and services through a single IP address, offering a resilient and globally distributed entry point for AWS resources.
4. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance:** The use of two IP addresses provides fault tolerance by isolating failure domains with separate network infrastructures within AWS. If one IP address becomes unavailable, traffic is automatically rerouted to the other, ensuring continuous availability.
5. **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP):** Global Accelerator allows customers to bring their own IP address blocks, supporting up to two /24 IPv4 blocks. This is ideal for organizations that want to use their own public IP addresses and maintain consistent network configuration.
6. **Traffic Engineering and Control:** The service allows for traffic flow customization using "traffic dials," which set the percentage of traffic sent to different AWS regions. This capability is particularly useful for blue/green deployments, failover scenarios, and load balancing across regions.
7. **Health Checks and Failover:** AWS Global Accelerator continuously monitors the health of application endpoints using customizable health checks (HTTP/HTTPS GET requests or TCP handshakes). If an endpoint becomes unhealthy, traffic is automatically redirected to a healthy endpoint, ensuring uninterrupted service.
8. **DDoS Protection:** AWS Global Accelerator includes built-in protection against denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks through AWS Shield Standard, at no additional cost. For enhanced protection, AWS Shield Advanced offers additional features, including 24/7 support, attack visibility, and cost protection.
9. **Custom Routing Accelerators:** For applications requiring specific routing control, custom routing accelerators can map specific IP ports to destinations across one or more AWS regions. This allows precise control over how incoming traffic is directed, which is beneficial for scenarios that require specific endpoint targeting, such as connecting to particular EC2 instances.

While both AWS Global Accelerator and CloudFront enhance content delivery, they serve different purposes. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations to bring it closer to users, primarily optimizing HTTP/HTTPS content delivery. On the other hand, Global Accelerator optimizes network performance by providing a faster network path to AWS services, regardless of the traffic type (TCP or UDP). Unlike CloudFront, Global Accelerator does not cache content but focuses on reducing latency and improving connectivity.
